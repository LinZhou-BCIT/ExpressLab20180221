# ExpressLab20180221
Lab for Express class 

# Requirements:

You will create an Express.JS app that behaves as follows:

    /api/countries displays the text file: ten_most_populated_countries.json

    /api/capitals displays the text file: canada_capitals.json

    / displays a home page with Bootstrap & the message "View JSON feeds" followed by links to the above two services

The JSON text files must be dynamically read from the file system.

- return contents of ten_most_populated_countries.json as pure raw JSON with Header >> Content-Type: application/json

- display the contents of canada_capitals.json in a neat looking and colorful HTML Bootstrap table in the view. 

You can use any view engine of your choice.

You are not allowed to use the express generator.

Deploy your application to Heroku  & Azure when you are done
